This is a gameplay/compatibility patch for Satanic Gameshow Deluxe and
Eviternity.

Please refer to the information below for instructions on how to use this
compatibility patch.


* REQUIREMENTS *

In order to use this compatibility patch, you must have all of the
following files:

Eviternity.wad
sgd_*.pk3

sgd_*.pk3 itself requires GZDoom 3.7.0 at a minimum to run. The patch
should be compatible with any version of both Eviternity.wad and sgd_*.pk3.
If, however, things do not seem to work as intended, do feel free to send a
bug report (instructions further below).


* LOAD ORDER *

The files should be loaded in the following order:

Eviternity.wad
sgd_*.pk3

Loading the files in any other order may (and most likely will) result in
things either not working as intended or being downright broken.
