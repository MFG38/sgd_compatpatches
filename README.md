# SGD Compatibility Patches
This is a collection of mod/megawad compatibility patches for the GZDoom gameplay mod Satanic Gameshow Deluxe. Each compatibility patch is contained in its own sub-folder. See below for instructions on compiling the patches.

## Currently included patches

This collection currently includes compatibility patches for the following mapsets and mods:

* Doom 64 for Doom 2
* Eviternity

## Compiling a patch

In order to compile a compatibility patch, the quickest way is to simply grab all the files included in its respective sub-folder and package them all into a ZIP archive. Then just load up SGD and the compatibility patch, along with the appropriate mapset/mod, and have fun!

## Load order

Generally, the files should be loaded in the following order: the mapset/mod goes first, SGD goes second, and the compatibility patch goes last. Any complementary mods should go after all of the other files in the load order. Exceptions are possible, however; if so, it'll be noted in the readme file of the appropriate compatibility patch.
